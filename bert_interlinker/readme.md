# BERT Semantic Page Interlinker

## Features
Automatically finds semantically relevant pages to link to. Just feed it a crawl file and the script will do the rest! 

Great for finding sementally related categories for ecommerce sites. 

For example, it can match semantically related categories like Dustbins and Cleaning Equipment even though syntically those words are very different.
